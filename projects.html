            Most business activity is managed by well-trained people following established practices. But sometimes to address changing markets, competition and / or growth aspirations, activities outside established practices are required.

            Entrepreneurs often blaze wildly circuitous trails in the early days. With larger investment comes the need to build organizations that scale.

    Some companies were built with sales ad  operations, but now are faced with stalling growth and complicated strategic questions about alliances and new market segments. They now need a formal marketing function.
